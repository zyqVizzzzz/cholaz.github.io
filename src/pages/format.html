                  <h3>The Firing of Sam Altman</h3>
                  <p>
                    On Friday, November 17th, at 12:19 PM, the OpenAI board
                    delivered a shocking message to Sam Altman in the absence of
                    Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, stating, "You're
                    fired." The meeting abruptly ended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minutes later, Greg Brockman received a Google Meet video
                    call request from Ilya Sutskever. At 12:23 PM, a conference
                    call began, announcing Brockman's removal from the board but
                    his retention as president. The swift and precise execution
                    of these actions indicated a premeditated move with no
                    hesitation or protracted discussions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rumors circulated that Sutskever, a co-founder and Chief
                    Scientist at OpenAI, was the mastermind behind a coup,
                    secretly aligning with three independent directors to
                    decisively vote 4:2 in favor of ousting Altman. OpenAI's
                    official website promptly announced changes in leadership,
                    with a cautious and vague statement. The statement suggested
                    that Altman's communication lacked transparency, hindering
                    the board's ability to fulfill its duties and eroding
                    confidence in his leadership.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simultaneously, OpenAI informed its major investor,
                    Microsoft, of the leadership changes. Microsoft CEO Satya
                    Nadella and other executives learned of this news just 5 to
                    10 minutes before the announcement, leaving them surprised.

              <h3>Inside Story and Big Twist</h3>
              <p>
                On Friday, November 17th, at 2 PM, OpenAI held an all-hands
                meeting to reassure employees and announced that CTO Murati
                would serve as interim CEO. However, Altman's departure was not
                without resistance. OpenAI's shareholders, including Airbnb CEO
                Brian Chesky and SV Angel founder Ron Conway, publicly voiced
                their support for Altman and Brockman.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Sunday, November 19th, in the morning, Altman and Brockman
                negotiated at OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters. The outcome
                of the negotiations was the appointment of Emmett Shear as CEO,
                not Altman. In the evening, OpenAI employees penned a
                strongly-worded open letter, threatening to resign and follow
                Altman and Brockman to Microsoft unless the board resigned and
                reinstated them.

              <h3>Sam Altman Joins Microsoft</h3>
              <p>
                On Monday, November 20th, in the afternoon, Satya Nadella
                explicitly expressed his welcome to Altman, Brockman, and other
                OpenAI employees on a media program, and announced that
                Microsoft had prepared laptops and GPU clusters at their
                LinkedIn office in San Francisco. However, due to ongoing
                negotiations between the board and OpenAI leadership, there were
                still no OpenAI employees at the office. It was understood that
                Microsoft's preference was for Altman to return as CEO to
                OpenAI.
              </p>
              <p>
                At midnight, Nadella officially tweeted the announcement of
                Altman joining Microsoft

                  <h3>Employees Force the Board of Directors</h3>
                  <p>
                    Around 2 AM on November 21st, OpenAI's top management
                    extended an olive branch to Altman, stating, "OpenAI Is
                    Nothing Without Its People" Altman retweeted some of these
                    messages, expressing support with heart emojis. The
                    employees' emotions reached a new peak, and the most
                    astonishing twist was that Ilya Sutskever, the main planner
                    of the coup, reversed his stance. At 5 AM, Sutskever posted
                    on X expressing regret for Altman's dismissal. Altman
                    retweeted this post and added three heart emojis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even at this point, interim CEO Shear threatened that if the
                    board couldn't clearly communicate the reasons for Altman's
                    dismissal, he would no longer serve as CEO.

                  <h3>Sam Altman's Return and Board Shakeup</h3>
                  <p>
                    "We have reached a preliminary agreement for Altman to
                    return as the CEO of OpenAI." As a prerequisite for Altman's
                    return, the board underwent a major reshuffle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New board members included Bret Taylor, former Salesforce
                    Co-CEO and current Facebook CTO responsible for long-term
                    technical development and overseeing the development of News
                    Feed, Search, and the Facebook platform. Larry Summers,
                    former U.S. Treasury Secretary, also joined the board.
